# TCP-vs-UDP

It is recommended that one carries out the programs in a Linux system/subsystem for consistency
with g++ installed.
tcpdump is recommended for packet capturing but wireshark would also do the job as well
For tcpdump use the following command for capturing packets:

```console
$ sudo tcpdump -i any src localhost
```

-> Problem_3_A has all the bespoke programs set to the given buffer specification(s)

-> Similar is the case for B, C and D as well

-> Also the 5 test books are there

warandpeace.txt -> largest [~3.2 MB]

Test.txt -> smallest [10KB]

And one can explore the other files as well as well
